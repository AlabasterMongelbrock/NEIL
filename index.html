<h2>About me</h2>
<hr />
<p>
There is a significant qualitative difference between “thinking something” and “doing something”. Doing goes further than thinking: it doesn’t just generate thoughts, it entangles those thought with reality. 

This afternoon, I hesitated to bet on a Manifold market because I didn’t feel that I knew enough about the subject in question. What I was doing was performing two different evaluations: 1) Can I trust this market and 2) should I invest mana in this market. The two were related: if I, an ignorant fool, decided to invest mana into the market, then I can suppose that that market is (in part) driven by fools.1 This is because my priors, through the mediocrity principle, are that I am an average investor in that market. 

There are those who claim that it is ridiculous to act as if my decision to join the market causally influences the usefulness of that market in any significant way (beyond casting one more vote). But those people are the type who lose a million dollars. I’m going to listen to the money, not shake my fist at reality for not making sense.2 

Regardless, this is an instance in which thinking about something and thinking about something enough that I do it has a real impact on my beliefs. Had I invested mana into the market, I would have entangled my thoughts with reality: I would have had to update my beliefs about the market’s accuracy downward. I would have crossed the entanglement frontier: thoughts would have escaped my cranium and affected the world, and in this particular case that means a big change, since I can expect other people like me to do the same.

1: Part of why the wisdom of the crowds works is that for every fool there is an equal and opposite fool out there. This you can derive from the central limit theorem, where Manifold investors form a bell curve and clump near the middle (truth) and the tail end major fools cancel out. But also, Robin Hanson points out that running prediction market with the 2% best traders significantly increases accuracy. Reversed stupidity is not intelligence, and raising the accuracy of the average reasoner beats out adding another thousand fools to your prediction market simply because stupidity is not strongly anti-correlated with truth. 
2: Also it’s not causal influence.
